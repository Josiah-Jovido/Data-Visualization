# Pandas Foundation
#### This repository contains jupyter notebooks that visualizes  the different functionalities of the Pandas Library
Pandas DataFrames are the most widely used in-memory representation of complex data collections within Python. Whether in finance, a scientific field, or data science, familiarity with pandas is essential. This repo shows how to work with real-world datasets containing both string and numeric data, often structured around time series.  It contains powerful analysis, selection, and visualization techniques.

#### Modules
* **Data ingestion & inspection**
In this section, I introduced pandas DataFrames. I used pandas to import and inspect a variety of datasets, ranging from population data obtained from the World Bank to monthly stock data obtained via Yahoo Finance. I also biult DataFrames from scratch and showed the intrinsic data visualization capabilities of pandas.
* **Exploratory data analysis**
After ingesting and inspecting the data, next is to explore it visually and quantitatively. This process, known as exploratory data analysis (EDA), is a crucial component of any data science project. Pandas has powerful methods that help with statistical and visual EDA. In this section, these techniques were applied.
* **Time series in pandas**
In this section, I covered how to manipulate and visualize time series data using pandas. I used concepts such as upsampling, downsampling, and interpolation. I also used method chaining to efficiently filter the data and perform time series analyses. From stock prices to flight timings, time series data can be found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with it is an invaluable skill.
